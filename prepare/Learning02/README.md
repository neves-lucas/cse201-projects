# **Abstraction practice: Classes**

For this assignment, I wrote a C# program with two classes to represent a resume or an job history:

**Resume**  
- Member variables:
    * _name : string
    * _jobs : List<Job>

- Behavior
    * Display() : void


**Job**
- Member variables:
    * _company : string
    * _jobTitle : string
    * _startYear : int
    * _endYear : int

- Behavior
    * Display() : void


This was a very simple program to practice the principles of Abstraction.

Sample output of the program could look as follows:


**_Name: Lucas Neves_** 

**_Jobs:_**

**_Software Engineer (Microsoft) 2019-22_**

**_Manager (Apple) 2022-2023_**
