# **Magic number game**

## **Core Requirements**
**1.** Start by asking the user for the magic number. (In future steps, you will change this to have the computer generate a random number, but to get started, we'll just let the user decide what it is.)
**1.1** Ask the user for a guess.
**1.2** Using an if statement, determine if the user needs to guess higher or lower next time, or tell them if they guessed it.
1.3 At this point, you won't have any loops.

**2.** Add a loop that keeps looping as long as the guess does not match the magic number.
At this point, the user should be able to keep playing until they get the correct answer.

**3.** Instead of having the user supply the magic number, generate a random number from 1 to 100.
Play the game and make sure it works!

## **Stretch Challenge:**

**1.** Keep track of how many guesses the user has made and inform them of it at the end of the game.
**2.** After the game is over, ask the user if they want to play again. Then, loop back and play the whole game again and continue this loop as long as they keep saying "yes".
