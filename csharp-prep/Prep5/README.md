# **Assignment Instructions**

For this assignment, write a C# program that has several simple functions:

**DisplayWelcome** - Displays the message, "Welcome to the Program!"
**PromptUserName** - Asks for and returns the user's name (as a string)
**PromptUserNumber** - Asks for and returns the user's favorite number (as an integer)
**SquareNumber** - Accepts an integer as a parameter and returns that number squared (as an integer)
**DisplayResult** - Accepts the user's name and the squared number and displays them.

Your Main function should then call each of these functions saving the return values and passing data to them as necessary.

Sample output of the program could look as follows:

_Welcome to the program!_
_Please enter your name: Brother Burton_
_Please enter your favorite number: 42_
_Brother Burton, the square of your number is 1764_
